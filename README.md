# VoxEng

VoxEng (short for Voxel Engine) is a voxel-based game engine written in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)).

VoxEng was created by developers [Hayden](https://github.com/wh-taylor) and
[Jans Heikkinen](https://github.com/jansheikkinen) to create a voxel-based game
that would be very easy to modify.

## Dependencies
+ [Lua](https://lua.org) - scripting language for mods
+ [Macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) - library game engine

VoxEng is currently in its Alpha stage.
