# VoxEng

VoxEng (short for Voxel Engine) is a voxel-based game engine written in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).

VoxEng was created by developers [Hayden](https://github.com/asianhaydenxd) and [Jans Heikkinen](https://github.com/jansheikkinen) to create a voxel-based game that would be very easy to modify. [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) is used as the scripting language.
